After clicking the **Calculate** button, the app instantly provides:
  **Estimated Liquidation Price**
  **Position Size** (number of tokens/contracts owned)
  **Smart Stop Loss Recommendation** (set at 5% below entry by default)
  **Risk if SL hits** (how much the user would lose)
  **Reward if TP hits** (how much the user would gain)
  **Risk:Reward Ratio**
  **Recommended TP Points** (2R and 3R based on the smart SL)
  **Stop Loss Saftey Check** (flags if SL is dangerously close to liquidation)

# Will it make you rich?
Short answer: **No** — this tool is not a money printer.

It’s designed to help **professional or aspiring traders** evaluate their trades more clearly by factoring in core risk metrics.  
However, users are still expected to have at least a **basic understanding of futures trading** before relying on this app. Think of it as a tool to **enforce your strategy**, not replace it.
